In this work, we Formalized an Android application to provide available seating space in libraries and friend finding facility by designing a smart algorithm to process data gathered through routers and IR sensors The four main modules of the project are: 1. Android Application 2. Server 3. Sensors 4. Router

Technology Details

Server Side: Technology NODE JS Framework EXPRESS JS Programming language JavaScript and python Data exchange format JSON by REST APIs Encryption used Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Operating system Linux Ubuntu Programming IDE Sublime text

Database: Technology MONGO DB – NoSQL Version : 2.6.5

CLOUD SERVICE MongoDB-as-service Host : Mongo Labs Plan: Sandbox

CLIENT SIDE (APP)

Technology Android Version V 4.0.3+ IDE Android Studio

HARDWARE SIDE

Sensors IR-LED, VS1838B TSOP Micro controllers Arduino Fio, XBEE-WiFi

Description Sensor platform: Hardware components used: Arduino Fio, Xbee, IR LED’s and receivers. Based on the order in which they are triggered it is determined if the person is entering or leaving and accordingly the count is incremented/decremented.The count is sent every 5 minutes.

Router: Assumption: A person in the library has at least one device connected to the internet. Router contains MAC address/IP address of users.Server connects to the router to obtain information.

Server: Server interacts with client (app), router and the sensor. Server code runs on NODE.js using express.js Server has dedicated methods which accepts the requests and data in the JSON format. Server is connected to MongoDB which is present in the cloud hosted by Mongo Labs.MongoDB is purely NoSQL DB.
